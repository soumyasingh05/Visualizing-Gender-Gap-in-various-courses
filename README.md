# Visualizing-Gender-Gap-in-various-courses
Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees
This project is to use data visualization to communicate insights and tell stories.
The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.
This gap is reported on often in the news and not everyone agrees that there is a gap.

Here we'll explore how we can communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization.
